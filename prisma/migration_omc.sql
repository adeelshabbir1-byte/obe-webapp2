-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor. Adds the OMC review comment field to Course.
-- Note: no change needed for the OMC role itself — "OMC" was already part
-- of the UserRole enum type from your very first database setup, so
-- creating OMC accounts will work without any additional migration here.

ALTER TABLE "Course"
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS "omcComment" TEXT;
